 						<div class="features">
 							<article>
 								<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/portrait.jpg" alt="" /></a>
 								<div class="inner">
 									<p>I’m a somatic psychotherapist and counsellor offering in-person somatic psychotherapy in Brisbane, and online for anyone across Australia.</p>
 									<p>I know it can be overwhelming to find a therapist who feels right for you. Here is a little about me to give you a sense of who I am and what it might be like to work with me. I trust that your intuition will lead you to the right fit!</p>
 								</div>
 							</article>
 							<div class="inner">
 								<p>When people ask me to share about myself, I almost always begin by saying I was born and raised in New York City. I’ve realized that my identity as a New Yorker, reared by generations of New Yorkers who were reared by Sicilian and Jewish immigrants, explains much about how I am in the world, something that became more obvious to me when I moved to the Bay Area. My background influences my therapeutic style. I can be direct, earnest, and bold, while maintaining warmth and sincerity. I love being a therapist because it allows me to harness my greatest strengths and it evokes my whole self—my creativity, my love of human connection, and my investigative mind. 
 									<br><br>
 									Other than being a psychotherapist, here are some other things that light me up. I love being outside, being barefoot, and going for walks. I love storytelling, both sharing and being shared with. I am a creative—I enjoy many art forms including music (listening, writing, performing, making mixtapes), visual art (painting, drawing, photography, jewelry-making), and writing (poetry, prose). I love traveling, going on and planning road trips, and seeing this world's many incredible crevices. I love food—all aspects of it, including sourcing delicious ingredients, learning about and experiencing dishes from different regions, practicing inventive cooking, feeding people I love, and, of course, eating. I love my little orange cat and spending time with my friends and family.

 						<h3>My Approach</h3>
 						<h4>Creating Safety</h4>
 						<p>I am committed to creating a safe and welcoming environment for people of every ethnicity, race, religion, immigration status, size, gender, sexuality, ability, age, and socioeconomic status. I understand how important it can be for your therapist to be aware of how social placement, marginalization, and proximity to privilege impact your wellbeing, whether or not these experiences are the focus of your therapy. My aim is to allow all of you to be at ease, so that a felt sense of safety can emerge and allow for your wholeness and integration.</p>
 						<h4>Therapeutic Style</h4>
 						<p>"The patient needs an experience, not an explanation.” — Frieda Fromm-Reichmann <br>My approach to psychotherapy is largely psychodynamic and relational. This means that my understanding and practice of psychotherapy reaches beyond the realm of problem-solving and cognitive override. Whereby other therapeutic styles may solely focus on the building of coping skills and changing one’s thinking and behavior, the psychodynamic and relational models I’m informed by orient us toward the relationship as the site of healing. We are hurt within relationships, and fortunately we are healed within them too. Good therapy offers you corrective experiences, not just interpretations and explanations. I also draw insight from the Internal Family Systems and Hakomi frameworks for intervention curation and nurturing the therapeutic relationship.</p>
 						<h4>Somatics</h4>
 						<p>Because of my training’s focus on a somatic approach to therapy, my style is informed by the body and its role in emotional wellbeing. All emotion begins as sensation in the body, from which we derive meaning and affect. I use body awareness techniques to help you develop a sense of your own emotional body. This awareness, sometimes called interoception, is usually the foundation of emotional vulnerability, healing, and managing your nervous system and stress’s impact on the body. Using psychoeducation, body-oriented exercises designed to regulate your nervous system, and a variety of psychotherapeutic tools for deep inquiry, we will co-create a space for your psychological wellbeing.</p>
