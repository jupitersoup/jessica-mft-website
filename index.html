										<p>Finding the right therapist can be overwhelming. Here is a little about me to help you get a sense of who I am and what it might be like to work with me.</p>
										<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/portrait.jpg" alt="" /></a>
										<div class="inner">
									<p>I'm an American expat, born and raised in New York City. I bring a grounded and heartfelt presence to the work I do, drawing insight from life experience and professional training.<br>
									<p>My therapeutic style is direct and sincere, while maintaining warmth and connection. I view therapy as a collaborative, creative process that invites your full self into the room and makes space for growth, healing, and integration.</p>

										<p>My therapeutic style is direct and sincere, while maintaining warmth and connection. I view therapy as a collaborative, creative process that invites your full self into the room and makes space for growth, healing, and integration.</p>
										<p>I was drawn to this work because I am enthralled by the transformative power of human connection. I’ve always been curious about how people work—emotionally, relationally, physically—and fascinated by the deep intelligence of the body. Becoming a therapist felt like a natural home for my creativity, intuition, and investigative mind. I love this work because it allows me to engage meaningfully with others and support them to become more authentic and resilient versions of themselves.</p>
										<p>Outside the therapy room, I love being outdoors, going for walks, and feeling the ground beneath my bare feet. I’m drawn to storytelling—both sharing my own and being trusted with others’. I’m a creative at heart, with a deep love for music (listening, writing, performing, making mixtapes), visual art (painting, drawing, photography, jewelry-making), and writing (poetry and prose). I’m passionate about travel—especially road trips—and finding the hidden beauty in this world’s many incredible crevices. I also love food in all its forms: sourcing delicious ingredients, learning about cuisines from different regions, cooking inventively, feeding people I care about, and of course, eating. My little orange cat, along with my friends and family, are some of my greatest sources of joy.</p>

						<h3>Therapeutic Approach</h3>
						<h4>Creating safety</h4>
						<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">I work with people across many life stages and identities and have a strong commitment to social justice and inclusivity. I believe it's important to cultivate a safe and welcoming environment for people with various marginalised identities by being aware of how social placement and proximity to privilege may impact your wellbeing, whether or not these experiences are the focus of our therapy.</p>
						<p>I approach therapy with a trauma-informed lens. This means I am attuned to how past experiences of trauma may shape your present-day responses, and I take care to ensure that our work together is grounded in autonomy, respect, and trust. We'll move at a pace that feels right for you, prioritising your sense of safety and control at every step. Together, we'll work to create a felt sense of security, so you can feel more grounded, connected, and free to be your authentic self.</p>
						<h4>Somatic, relational, and psychodynamic therapies</h4>
 						<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">My therapeutic approach is integrative and rooted in somatic, psychodynamic, and relational frameworks. While some modalities focus mainly on building coping skills or changing thoughts and behaviours, the models that inform my practice emphasise the therapeutic relationship as the site of healing. Though many of our wounds are formed in relationships, fortunately they are healed within them too. Good therapy offers corrective experiences, not just interpretations or explanations. I believe that true healing happens in both the mind and the body—through reparative experiences, embodied awareness, and supportive, attuned connection.</p>
						<p>My style is also grounded in the belief that our bodies have an innate capacity for healing and tend to move toward this when given the right conditions to do so. At times, though, this process can be disrupted by protective adaptations—the very coping strategies that once kept us safe, but now limit our capacity for authenticity, presence, and connection. Therapy can offer a supportive space to become vulnerable, understand these now maladaptive barriers, and create new experiences, unburdening you from these once necessary safeguards from the past.</p>
						<h4>What you can expect in sessions</h4>
						<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"></p>I tend to work in a client-centred way, meaning I follow your lead in sessions. Therapy with me is non-directive and feels more like a conversation than a clinical interaction. I don’t come in with an agenda; instead, I aim to meet you wherever you are on the day while gently weaving in themes that emerge over time to help us make connections and build insight.
						<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">To support the therapeutic process, I often incorporate different elements into our work:</p>
						<ul style="margin-top: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
							<li style="margin-left: 4em;">Body-based practices and interoceptive awareness</li>
							<li style="margin-left: 4em;">Nervous system regulation techniques</li>
							<li style="margin-left: 4em;">Experiential and creative interventions</li>
							<li style="margin-left: 4em;">Mindfulness and psychoeducation</li>
						</ul>
						<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">I draw from a range of therapeutic modalities including Internal Family Systems (IFS), Hakomi, Interpersonal Neurobiology, and trauma-informed models, as well as creative approaches like drama therapy, somatic experiencing, and play therapy. These tools and techniques support deeper emotional awareness and lasting change.</p>
